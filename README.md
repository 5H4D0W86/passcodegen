# PasscodeGen üîê

PasscodeGen is a Python-based tool that generates secure, random passwords on demand. It was built to help busy professionals who frequently update work passwords and want strong, hassle-free passcodes at the push of a button.

## üß† Why I Built This

As a working professional in law enforcement, I‚Äôm required to update my work passwords every few months. After running out of creative ideas, I decided to build this tool to quickly generate strong, base64-style passwords that meet security standards. My long-term goal is to turn this into a simple website that both I and my coworkers can use anytime, anywhere.

## üöÄ Features

- Secure random password generation using `os.urandom` and `base64`
- User-defined password length
- Generates 5 different password options each run
- Option to regenerate until satisfied

## üõ† How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/5H4D0W86/passcodegen.git
   cd passcodegen
````

2. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

3. Enter your desired password length when prompted, and view 5 strong passwords instantly.

## üóÇ Project Structure

```
passcodegen/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ password_generator.py   # Python script that runs the generator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # This file - project documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore              # (Optional) ignores system/cache files
```

## üí° Example Output

```
Please enter the length of the password: 12

#1: 7$Km2FxqG#bZ
#2: R!9pTq1@WvF#
#3: x#ZR0!j72NmA
#4: $b4YwLt!Xp9Q
#5: A@Lr6P%8NzWd
```

If none of the options work for you, you can simply re-run the script and generate 5 new ones instantly.

## üìà Future Improvements

* Build a lightweight front-end using Flask
* Add password strength meter
* Add "copy-to-clipboard" functionality
* Deploy as a web app for coworkers to use via browser
* Add option to export passwords to a secure text file
